<p>I am currently enrolled in <b>Dev.Build 4</b>, looking to learn as much as possible on my way to becoming a Software engineer.</p>
<br />
<p>One of the projects we worked on was to build a Used Car Lot. It would have vehicles for sale that could be purchased as well as allow users to sell vehicles to the dealership.

<br />
<p>Another project we worked on was a program that would convert whatever was typed in to Pig Latin.

<br />
<p>Lastly, a project we worked on was a Point of Sale application that allowed a user to purchase items, creates itemized receipts, calculates taxes, and calculates change.
