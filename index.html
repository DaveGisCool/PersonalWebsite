<h3>A little about me...</h3>
<p>For a while I would have said one of my favorite past times would have been watching TV. Even now in the golden age of television, I watch TV less than I ever have and the once <i>lengthy</i> list of shows I followed have <i>sadly</i> dwindled down to a paltry number of shows. Many of the shows I watched have run their course and have ended. Some honorable mentions are Eureka, Felicity, The Magicians, Mr Robot, Smallville, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Utopia, Continuum, Arrested Devlopment, Dead Like Me, and Pushing Daisies.</p>

<ol><h4>These are my three favorite shows of all time:</h4>
<li>Futurama</li>
<li>Gilmore Girls</li>
<li>Fringe</li>
</ol>

<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>Now in addition to watching television, a large amount of time in my life was spent playing video games. This started pretty young when I would play Dodge Em on Atari and I got Pac-Man and E.T. for one of my early birthdays. </p>

<p>When the Nintendo Entertainment System came out, my family got the bundle with Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. This kicked off my video gaming habits that have also seemed to taper off as I got older.</p>
<p>I have continued to game and currently have quite a collection between a few different systems:</p>

<h3>Did someone say coding?</h3>
<p>As a young curious kid, I (on several occasions) took apart the family pc. It was a Tandy 386. It was also needed for homework (as well as printing homework to our dot-matix printer) and so it had to be reassembled and <i>working</i> whenver I decided to take it apart. While I fairly quickly figured out what the parts inside did, I was always pretty facinated by how programs actually ran.</p>
<p>So in highschool, I enrolled in my first programming course. PASCAL. This game me a great appreciation for logic and binary pathing. This also helped inspire me to practice a little coding on my graphing calculator (TI-81) and learned how to take input from a user and solve the quadratic equasion with them. Each time you pressed enter on the calculator would show the next step in completing the proof.</p>
<p>This is where I learned that creating something to show others how to do something (what the program was intended for) really was an amazing way to learn something. By the time I got done coding it, I didn't even need the program any more.</p>
<p>Once I got to college, I found out you could make your own web pages using tools and sites online. I would browse some Geocities or Angelfire sites, read their code, copy and paste some of it, check out webmonkey, and eventually I jumbled together enough working stuff to make a horrendous, ugly site! I decided to continue taking programming courses.<p>
<p>I enrolled in FORTRAN, COBOL, Java, C, and C++. While I didn't continue working on any of these languages much past these classes, one of my Communication 200 courses taught us HTML and the beginnings of CSS (this was around 2000). And as part of our final project, I had spoken with the chair of the Ethics department about redesigning their (previously fairly terrible) site. I worked with a couple guys to implement what we knew and worked with the secretary in the office to install DreamWeaver and show her enough to update pages as necessary!</p>

<h3>What's going on now?</h3>
<p>I now have an almost 5 year old son who keeps me incredibly busy. He never stops moving from the second he wakes up until he resists bedtime and finally succumbs, far later than he should. He's got a wild imagination and he likes to recreate anything he sees or hears, with plenty of rules and direction, for hours on end. </p>
<p>He really likes going to parks, going for walks, and recently, learning to ride his bike! This also explains why I have less time for watching television and playing video games for oh... about the last 5 years.</p>
