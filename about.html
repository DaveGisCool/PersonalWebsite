<h2 style="text-align: center;"> About Me </h2>
<br />
<p>Hi there! My name is Dave Gedert! Before joining the Family of Companies, I had worked at the same company for 16 years, which was half my life at that point.</p>

<p>When I had first come to the FoC in 2012, I started as a HUD Reviewer for Amrock (FKA Title Source, Inc. at that point in time). I started in Troy and had no idea what I was in for. I learned about title work, title insurance, the title process, and where titles fit in the big picture of mortgages. And I learned all of it pretty quickly.</p>
<p>After three years on the team, I became the Team Captain. It was a great role that allowed me to dig into existing processes, find answers, and more importantly, train all the new and existing team members, setting all of them up for the best success possible.</p>
<p>After being the Team Captain for a while, another opportunity came along. I shadowed a role in Quicken Loans Servicing called Investor Reporting. These teams report on every single loan QL originates to the investor who purchases the loan asset. They have to report monthly for each loan and sometimes multiple times per month. They also have to remit all the funds collected from the client to the investors. AND they have to solve puzzles daily and monthly when loans get out of their expected statuses and reconcile them back to where they should be. This role was a challenge and six months after I started, every aspect of how the role was performed was on a schedule to change completely due to completely new processes and systems.</p>
<p>I was enjoying my time Reporting, Remitting, and Reconciling when I had learned that there was an open role in Servicing Training supporting the team I worked on. I jumped at the chance to interview and made my way to the Training team. In the three years I was on the training team, I had a chance to train not only the team I came from, but also to train dozens of other teams and learn tons of different processes.</p>
<p>My pride and joy I left behind on Servicing Training is the <b>Love Protect Amaze with Drew and Dave podcast</b> that I co-created with <a href="https://foc.justsift.com/profile/1VMceQiGGDiVjN2a3C64ns">Drew Powell</a>. We co-wrote each episode, co-directed, co-produced, co-hosted, and took turns editing every single episode to present them to the team members in Servicing.</p>
<p>I now find myself part of <b>Dev.Build 4</b>, loving all the new things I'm learning and building and working with all the cool people in my class.</p>

<p>If you're looking to contact me, see the footer at the bottom of the page. It has a link to my Sift Profile and a link to email me. You can also find me on Teams.</p>
